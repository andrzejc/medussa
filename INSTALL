Medussa installation instructions.


On Linux
========

Build Requirements
------------------

 You will need the devel packages for python and numpy (>= 1.3). Header 
 files for portaudio and libsndfile are included. 


Runtime requirements
--------------------

 * Python <www.python.org>. Any version >= 2.6. 

 * Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>. Version 1.3 or later should work.

 * Portaudio <http://www.portaudio.com>. Only tested with v19, November 21, 
   2011, SVN rev 1788 (later versions should be fine).

 * Libsndfile <http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>. Only tested with version 
    1.0.25, July 13 2011 (later versions should be fine).


Building and installing
-----------------------

 (This is assuming that you have a compatible Python and NumPy installed)
 From a command prompt, go the the Medussa directory and type:
 
 reinstall_linux.sh 2.7 
 
 (Replace "2.7" with whatever Python version you want to use.)
 
 This removes any existing version, rebuilds the lib, and installs the package.


Building the Medussa shared lib
-------------------------------

 (this doesn't actually install anything, it only builds the lib) 
 From a command prompt, type:
 
 cd lib/build/linux
 ./build.sh 2.7
 # lib will be at py2.7/libmedussa.so
 cd ../../..

 
On Windows:
===========
 
Building and installing
-----------------------

 Assuming that you have a compatible Python and NumPy (>= 1.3) installed, and
 you're using MSVC 10:
 
 From a command prompt, go the the Medussa directory and type:
 
 reinstall_win.bat 2.7
 
 (Replace "2.7" with whatever Python version you want to use.)
 
 This uninstalls any existing version, rebuilds the msi, & installs the msi.


Building the Medussa DLL
------------------------

 (this doesn't actually install anything, it only builds the lib):
	
 * Open the Visual Studio 10 project at:
   \medussa\lib\build\win\msvc10\medusa.vcxproj

 * Select the Solution Configuration according to the Python version you're 
   using (I chose Release Py2.7).
	
 * Choose Build Solution from the Build menu (or hit F7).
