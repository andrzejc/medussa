On Linux
========

Build Requirements
------------------

 You will need the devel packages for python and numpy (>= 1.3). 


Runtime requirements
--------------------

 The following will need to be installed:

 portaudio <http://www.portaudio.com>. Only tested with v19, November 21, 2011, 
 SVN rev 1788 (or later).

 libsndfile <http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>. Only tested with version 
 1.0.25, July 13 2011 (or later).

 numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>. Version 1.3 or later should work.


Building and installing
-----------------------

 This assuming that you have a compatible Python and NumPy installed)
 From a command prompt, go the the Medussa directory and type:
 
 reinstall_linux.sh 2.7
 
 (Replace "2.7" with whatever Python version you want to use. Medussa builds 
 and runs fine with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2, although others might be ok too)
 
 This removes any existing version, rebuilds the lib, and installs the package.


Building the Medussa shared lib
-------------------------------

 (this doesn't actually install anything, it only build the lib) 
 From a command prompt, type:
 
 cd lib/build/linux
 ./build.sh 2.7
 cd ../../..

 
On Windows:
===========
 
Building and installing
-----------------------

 Assuming that you have a compatible Python and NumPy (>= 1.3) installed, and
 you're using MSVC 10:
 
 From a command prompt, go the the Medussa directory and type:
 
 reinstall_win.bat 2.7
 
 (Replace "2.7" with whatever Python version you want to use. Medussa builds 
 and runs fine with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2, although others might be ok too)
 
 This uninstalls any existing version, rebuilds the msi, & installs the msi.

Building the Medussa DLL
------------------------

 (this doesn't actually install anything, it only build the lib):
	
 1. Open the Visual Studio 10 project at:
    \medussa\lib\build\win\msvc10\medusa.vcxproj

 2. Select the Solution Configuration according to the Python version you're 
    using (I chose Release Py2.7).
	
 3. Choose Build Solution from the Build menu (or hit F7).
