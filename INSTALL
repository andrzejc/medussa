Building and installing on linux:
===========================

 Assuming that you have a compatible Python and NumPy installed:
 
 From a command prompt, go the the Medussa directory at type:
 
 reinstall_linux.sh 2.7
 
 (Replace "2.7" with whatever Python version you want to use. Medussa has been 
 built successfully with Python 2.7 and 3.2, although others might be fine)
 
 This removes any existing version, rebuilds the lib, and installs the package.
 
 
Building and installing on Windows:
===========================

 Assuming that you have a compatible Python and NumPy installed, and you're 
 using MSVC 10:
 
 From a command prompt, go the the Medussa directory at type:
 
 reinstall_win.bat 2.7
 
 (Replace "2.7" with whatever Python version you want to use. Medussa has been 
 built successfully with Python 2.7 and 3.2, although others might be fine)
 
 This uninstalls any existing version. Rebuilds the msi. Installs the msi.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Building the Medussa DLL only (this doesn't actually install anything though):
	
	1. Open the Visual Studio 10 project at:
	\medussa\lib\build\win\msvc10\medusa.vcxproj
	
	2. Select the Solution Configuration according to the Python version you're using (I chose Release Py2.7).
	
	3. Choose Build Solution from the Build menu (or hit F7).
